# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognization
In this project , we will recognize the emotions of a human being using the live camera. This will show a box over the person's face and its emotion near the box. This model is build using CNN , Keras and Tensorflow 2.0.

## Introduction
The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has contributed a lot to the technology world. As the traditional algorithms failed to meet the human needs in real time, Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have gained great success.
Emotion plays a vital role in determining the thoughts, behaviour and feeling of a human.
With the help of an emotion recognition system we can build different applications such as feedback analysis, face unlocking, automatic screen capture etc. with good accuracy. 

## Objective
This project aims at identifying the human emotions and classify them in seven diffrent categories that are : Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise.
This project is also able to classify emotions in real time.

## Dataset
This model is trained using the FER-2013 dataset. 
This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions mentioned above.
